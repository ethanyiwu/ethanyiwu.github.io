Hi there! I am a senior undergraduate computer science student in [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I am very fortunate to work with [Prof. Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/) and [Sean Chuang](https://yunshiuan.github.io/). Previously, I transferred from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and I also spent some time in [UIUC](https://www.wisc.edu).

My research aims to bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence, a pursuit both challenging and essential.
