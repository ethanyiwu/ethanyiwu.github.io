Hi there! I am a senior undergraduate computer science student in [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I am very fortunate to work under the supervision of [Prof. Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/), [Prof. Timothy T. Rogers](https://psych.wisc.edu/staff/rogers-timothy-t/) and [Dr. Sean Chuang](https://yunshiuan.github.io/) currently. I also spent some time with [Dr. Weiqi Wang](https://mighty-weaver.github.io/) and [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/).

My research aims to bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence, a pursuit both challenging and essential. Specifically, I am interested in how to:
- build AI system that has stronger reasoning abilities
- devising strategies for model adaptability amidst domain shifts, particularly in NLP,
- exploring AI agents' group behaviors and creating collaborative AI in realistic settings, and 
- establishing links between cognitive science and AI, using the former to elucidate the latter. 

I am on leave from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and I did my exchange at [UIUC](https://www.wisc.edu).
